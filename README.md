# Installation
* Download the AddOn by clicking the "Download ZIP" button
* Extract the downloaded ZIP
* Rename the innermost folder (containing the AddOn files) to `KeyPressedReleasedMacroButton`
* Copy that folder into your **WoW\Interface\AddOns** folder

# Usage
Open core.lua in a text editor (one with Lua syntax highlighting is preferred, but not required) and add entries to the SPELL_IDS table for any spell you want to play a crit sound for.

You can also change the SOUND_FILE setting to play a different sound file.
